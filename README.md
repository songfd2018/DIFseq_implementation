# Implementation of Differential inference for scRNA-seq data

## Overview

This repository contains the code for the manuscript **Differnetial inference for Single-cell RNA-sequencing Data**.

## Download Raw Count Data

Please download the raw count data of the human pancreas study and the human COVID-19 study from [the OneDrive link](https://mycuhk-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/1155082896_link_cuhk_edu_hk/EW-UIYqDLIRNk8DwWP823AUBKmeh_c9__Rs-7YrtOO34zA?e=PJlW1u) with password `DIFseq2023`. To run the reproduction code, please place the `RawCountData` folders into their corresponding `Pancreas` and `Covid` folders, respectively.

## Regenerating the figures

Please find the **README** file in each folder to regenerate the figures in the manuscript.
